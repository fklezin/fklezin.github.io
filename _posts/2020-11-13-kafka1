_Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event streaming is set of different practices that handles:
* Capturing data in real-time from event sources like databases, sensors, mobile devices, cloud services, and software applications in the form of streams of events and store them   for later retrieval 
* Manipulating, processing, and reacting to the event streams in real-time and retrospectively.
* Routing the event streams to different destinations.
* Event streaming to ensure continuous flow so that the right data is at the right place, at the right time.


What is Kafka capable of?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kafka is end-to-end solution which combines three key capabilities:

* Publish (write) and subscribe to (read) streams of events, including continuous import/export of your data from other systems.
* To store streams of events durably and reliably for as long as you want.
* To process streams of events real-time or retrospectively.

It is distributed, highly scalable, elastic, fault-tolerant, and secure. 
Can be deployed on bare-metal hardware, virtual machines, and containers, and on-premises as well as in the cloud. 
You can choose between self-managing your Kafka environments and using fully managed services offered by a variety of vendors.

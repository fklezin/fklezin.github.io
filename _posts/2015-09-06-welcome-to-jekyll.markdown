_"Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform"_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event streaming is technique for capturing data in real-time from event sources like databases, sensors, mobile devices, cloud services, 
and software applications in the form of streams of events and them for later retrieval.
 
* Manipulating, processing, and reacting to the event streams in real-time and retrospectively.
* Routing the event streams to different destination technologies as needed.
* Event streaming thus ensures a continuous flow and interpretation of data so that the right information is at the right place, 
  at the right time.
